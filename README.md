# ft_irc Project
This project entailed developing a custom IRC server using C++, leveraging Socket and Network
programming. IRC facilitates real-time text communication between internet-connected computers,
supporting group discussions in “channels,” private messaging, and client-side commands. We mastered
TCP/IP (v4) communication between clients and servers and implemented IRC protocols to ensure robust
and efficient communication.
