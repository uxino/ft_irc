# ft_irc Project

The ft_irc project is an implementation of an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) system. Through this project, I gained in-depth knowledge of socket programming and the intricacies of server-client communication. The main objective of this project was to facilitate real-time messaging between users, providing a hands-on experience in network programming and protocol design.
